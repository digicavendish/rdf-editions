# rdf-editions
Most of these encoded editions will be based on the transcriptions performed by the Early English Books Online Text Creation Partnership. (Phase I texts are available for reuse, according to the terms of Creative Commons 0 1.0 Universal. The texts can be copied, modified, distributed and performed, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.) However, these versions of the texts are being enriched by members of the Digital Cavendish Project in order take advantage of the affordances of linked open data. Much of this work will be performed using the CWRC-Writer, a text markup editor developed by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory.
